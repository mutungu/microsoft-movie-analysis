readme ## MICROSOFT PROJECT
## Introduction
Microsoft wants to establish a movie studio in its bid to expand beyond the products it currently offers. However, the film industry is very unpredictable and there is need to have an established set of facts that the executives can use to make the right decision when entering the market.

## Business understanding 
In a highly volatile industry like the film industry, there is no better way to understand it than to look at the existing data for insights which are actionable and will enable Microsoft to exploit opportunities that are there. Data has been labeled as the ‘new oil’ as it is the one true and proven way of validating hype. Microsoft is looking for solid facts which can help it establish a movie studio and hit the ground running. 
## Data analysis and recommendations
For this project, the following datasets will be used:

1.Bommovie dataset which contains data on title of the film, studio that produced film, domestic_gross profits, Foreign_gross profits and Year when the film was produced.

2.Movie_info dataset which has data on genre, director, box-office revenue and runtime. 

3.IMDb database which contains data on various characteristics of films produced around the world.

Using a cocktail of descriptive statistics and data visualization, data will be analyzed to look for insights guided by the following hypotheses;
1.	Which studios are currently performing well and are expected to be potential competitors?
2.	How does the foreign and domestic markets compare?
3.	Which are the highest earning genres in the box-office?
4.	What is the optimal runtime for a film?
5.	Which are the top ten highly rated genres?

Foreign markets bring in more money than the domestic market. It is important to point out that both markets are important to maximize profits. Foreign markets are likely to generate extra revenue because they serve a larger audience compared to the domestic market. Investing in movies that command foreign markets would give an opportunity to make some bit of more money than a film that would only command domestic audience. However, caution should be taken as foreign markets require more funding as films need serious marketing to gain attraction and attract audiences.
### Which are the highest earning genres in the box-office?

Comedy movies make good money on the box office because they do not require huge budgets to produce and can market themselves pretty much easily as someone is likely to recommend it to someone else. Additionally, cross-genre comedies make comedy films to be so attractive as comedy can be wrapped around any plot. Following closely is drama which share the same characteristics with comedy films for being versatile and costing less in production. Another genre that is also reaping big profits in the box office is the mystery and suspense genre coupled with action and adventure which is also popular for its versatility and ease of integration into other genres.

The optimal runtime of a film is approximately 90 minutes (60 min to 120 min)

Cross-genre documentaries, reality-tv, history, sport, drama and game-show attract a high rating. Of particular focus is the documentary genre which seems to be popular with many. 
## Recommendations
•	Foreign markets provide more opportunities to maximize profits than the domestic market. However, they require huge investments in marketing.

•	Comedy films are very popular. They have two obvious advantages of being low cost and highly versatile that they can be integrated into other genres.

•	A film should last approximately 90 minutes (60 min - 120 min) to ensure that viewers maximize utility.

•	Documentaries provide an easy opportunity to enter into the market as they are low cost and require less marketing as they are based on individuals who already have a following or are based on events that most people are familiar with.
